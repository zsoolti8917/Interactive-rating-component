## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This was my first project where i used JavaScript. I choosed this because i tought it will be easy, but i have to admit that i was wrong. I learned a lot of things about JavaScript during this project and i'm happy with the result. I'm sure that there are better ways to do this. It was really hard to figure out how to make the stars clickable and how to make the "Thank you" card appear after clicking on a star.


### Continued development

I dont plan to add anything more to this project. I think it's finished and i'm happy with it. I will continue to learn and practice with new projects.
